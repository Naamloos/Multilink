# Multilink
A small page that displays multiple links on a single page. Loads from JSON.

## How to use
1. Download source code
2. Rename `links.template.json` to `links.json`
3. Modify `links.json` to your needs
4. Upload to your server

**note that it is recommended to host images on your own domain if you're using HTTPS.**

## Sample
I'm hosting an instance for my Twitter/Instagram bio as these only allow one link to be set. You can preview it [here](https://l.naamloos.dev/).
